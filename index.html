    <h1>Feature 1 Zruptive Project</h1>
    <h2>Update Github 'repo structure' so we can demonstrate the use case:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>developer makes a change to their feature branch</li>
            <ol>
                <li>developer pulls master branch from Github using Git in a terminal: <pre>git pull origin master or git clone * repo url *</pre></li>
                <li>developer switches to the desired branch <pre>git checkout -b feature1</pre></li>
                <li>changes are made to the new feature1 branch and committed <pre>git commit -m "enter what was changed here"</pre></li>
                <li>changes are pushed from the local repo to the remote repo feature1 branch <pre>git push origin -feature1</pre></li>
                
            </ol>
        <li>developer submits a pull request from Github page
            <ol>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
            
        </li>
        <li>lead developer reviews/approves/denys pull request from Github page
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Once a pull request has been made, the maintainer will see a message on the screen like this.
                    <img src="./pull1.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="./pull2.PNG" />
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>code merged into master when pull request is approved
            <ol>
                <li>feature1 branch is deleted in remote repo <pre>this is done after the pull request approval</pre></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
